# My Tooling
This is just a dropbox location via Github for various tooling I like to use in my day to day life in Linux / MacOS.

In here you'll find things like `.vimrc`, `.oh-my-zsh` and other `zsh` settings, and more.

## Word to the Wise
Don't just blanket take these from me. There is no guarantee that they will work in the way you want them to!
